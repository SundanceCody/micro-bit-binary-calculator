# micro-bit-binary-calculator
Arduino sketch that turns the BBC micro:bit into a simple, 4-bit, binary calculator.

This is a simple binary calculator that takes two, 4-bit numbers and adds them together to produce a 5-bit result. I've been wanting to do a simple, binary calculator ever since seeing a binary clock program running on the micro:bit. The debounce code is adapted directly from the example included with the Arduino IDE at "File", "Examples", "Digital", "Debounce". I learned how to display pixels on the micro:bit's display from adafruit's matrix demo included with their micro:bit library. If you haven't already, check out their tutorial at https://learn.adafruit.com/use-micro-bit-with-arduino. Other than that, the bulk of the logic is my own design, which undoubtedly means that it could be improved, so please feel free to tinker with the code ;)

Good luck, and happy coding!
